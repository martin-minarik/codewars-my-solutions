# Description:

The [Ones' Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement) of a binary number is the number obtained by swapping all the 0s for 1s and all the 1s for 0s. For example:



```
onesComplement(1001) = 0110
onesComplement(1001) = 0110

```


```
ones\_complement(1001) = 0110
ones\_complement(1001) = 0110

```


```
ones\_complement(1001) = 0110
ones\_complement(1001) = 0110

```


```
        onesComplement(1001) = 0110
        onesComplement(1001) = 0110

```

For any given binary number,formatted as a string, return the Ones' Complement of that number.

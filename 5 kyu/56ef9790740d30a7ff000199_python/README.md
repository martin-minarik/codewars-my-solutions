# Description:

Given the root of a tree with an arbitrary number of child nodes, return a list containing the nodes' data in breadth-first order (left to right, top to bottom).


Child nodes are stored in a list. An empty tree is represented by an empty list.


Example:



```
           1
          / \
         2   3  -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
        /|\   \
       4 5 6   7

```
